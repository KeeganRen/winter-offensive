Vector3d f;           //!< Unit-bearing vector of the feature.
what is unit-bearing?
feature's coordinate up to a unit distance

2. SVO_WARN_STREAM_THROTTLE(2.0, "First image has less than 100 features. Retry in more textured environment.");

addFirstFrame:
detect features (not the map points, just the good features to track)
check number of features
set reference frame
cp reference feature vector to current feature vector (because the output vector must have the same size as in the input in cv::calcOpticalFlowPyrLK method)

addSecondFram
trackklt
computeHomography
outlier remove
rescale the map to match the specified scale
all the inliers are projected on to both frame, bond to both frame, marked as initial map points

disparities_ distance between matched features of the first two frames

  /// Transforms pixel coordinates (c) to frame unit sphere coordinates (f).
  inline Vector3d c2f(const double x, const double y) const { return cam_->cam2world(x, y); }


what does it mean?
  vector<Feature*>              key_pts_;               //!< Five features and associated 3D points which are used to detect if two frames have overlapping field of view.
